    ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/Justice-source/Library-class.git
    
2. Run the code in visual studio code through your terminal:
   ```shell
    node index.js


To run the game:
Make sure you are using an up to date version of Visual Studio Code.
Install pygame using the command - pip install pygame.
In the instructional video I used in developing this game, the tutor made use of the nltk module which is similar to spacy module.
I compromised by making use of a txt file filled with 194,000 words from the English Language (gwicks.net/dictionaries.htm) and injected that into my python file.
Adjust the file paths of the assets depending on the system you use as my file paths will differ from yours.
Make sure to have python installed on your PC.
You can also edit the python file to give you different outcomes in the game like speed settings.
Run the python file to start the game up.Enjoy.
