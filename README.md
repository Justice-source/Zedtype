4. Pygame is a set of Python modules designed for writing games. It is written on top of the excellent SDL library. This allows you to create fully featured games and multimedia programs in the python language. The package is highly portable, with games running on Windows, MacOS, OS X, BeOS, FreeBSD, IRIX, and Linux.

7. In the instructional video I used in developing this game, the tutor made use of the nltk module which is similar to spacy module.

8. I compromised by making use of a txt file filled with 194,000 words from the English Language [Source of the txt files I used](gwicks.net/dictionaries.htm) and injected that into my python file.
Adjust the file paths of the assets depending on the system you use as my file paths will differ from yours.

9. Make sure to have python installed on your PC.

10. You can also edit the python file to give you different outcomes in the game like speed settings.
